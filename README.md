# Prework-study-guide

## Description

This Prework study guide was created so I and other bootcamp students could review what we have learned so far and have a place to add notes in the future. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this study guide you can review the notes in each section. For a suggestion on what to study you can use the chrome developer tools. To do so either command + click on Mac or right click the page on windows. From the menu that opens  go to the "inspect" option at the bottom. From there a new menu will open. At the top you can see that you are on the "Elements" tab by default. To the right of the "Elements" tab is the "Console" tab. Click it and a new menu will open that lists all of the topics covered in the study guide and a randomized suggestion of what to study first.
